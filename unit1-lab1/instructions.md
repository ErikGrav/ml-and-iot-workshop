# Lab 1 - Introducing ML and Deep Learning

In this lab, you'll learn the basics of Deep Learning and explore various Deep Learning approaches with TensorFlow.

1. You'll want to familiarize yourself with TensorFlow, which we will use throughout this workshop. [This guide from the TensorFlow team](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb) is the best place to start.
2. Spend some time working through [this online Google Co-Lab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bInysu4FdfPoMYxWzcJoyQwHVHbrpFZV?usp=sharing) which walks through several types of Deep Learning approaches, with examples in TensorFlow.
1. Start with [this local notebook](simple-neural-network.ipynb) which introduces Deep Learning concepts in a framework-free way using examples from the book "Grokking Deep Learning" by Andrew Trask.
